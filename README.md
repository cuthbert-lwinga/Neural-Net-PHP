## Introduction 🎉
Hey there, machine learning enthusiasts! 🌟 Welcome to Neural-Net-PHP, where we're making machine learning in PHP not just possible but super fun! 🎉 Inspired by the awesome book "Neural Networks from Scratch in Python" by Harrison Kinsley, we're on a mission to jazz up the PHP world with neural networks! 🧠🔥

## Installation 🛠

Clone this baby and let Composer work its magic. 🪄

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Neural-Net-PHP.git
cd Neural-Net-PHP
composer install
```

## Usage 🚀
Ready for takeoff! 🚀 Just import the library and unleash the neural network goodness! 🌈 Detailed docs are coming soon (because I am obsessed lmao 😅 ).

```php
// Some uber-cool example code goes here!
```

## Testing 🔬

Hold your horses! 🐴 Before we dive into the cool ML stuff, let's make sure everything's working as it should. Run these tests to keep your neural nets in tip-top shape! 👌

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

You should see a looong list of passed tests like:

```
TESTING....[testZeros1D]
.
...
TESTING....[Activation_Softmax_Loss_CategoricalCrossentropy Forward]
.
```

All tests should pass, and we're talking zero room for error—tolerance of just \(0.00001\)! 🎯

## Features ✨

- 🧠 Neural networks in PHP? Yes, please!
- 🎉 Fun and easy to use! (Just like me!)
- 🔬 Comprehensive unit tests to keep you on track!
- ... and more awesomeness coming your way! 🌈

## Technical Considerations 🤔

- PHP isn't Python, and that's okay! 🤷‍♂️ Some things might behave a smidge differently.
- Decimal places got you down? Don't worry, our tests have got you covered with a tiny-tiny tolerance! 🎯
- I made NumpyLight by painfully running python and building the NumpyLight in its image

## Acknowledgements 🙏

- Huge shoutout to Harrison Kinsley for his must-read book "Neural Networks from Scratch in Python"! 📚 You rock, man! 🤘
